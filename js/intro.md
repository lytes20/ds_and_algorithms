### Generators in JS

When should generators be used:

- When one wants to move out of a function
- Control asynchronous call outside the code.

### Promises in Javascript

- Promises are used to help manage asynchronous operations, such as server requests.
  Callbacks were used for the same purpose. However callbacks have limited functionality and thus can make the code unmanaeable.

Four states in the promise object:

- Pending. This is the first state of the promise
- Fulfilled. Completion of the asynchronous operation
- Rejected. Failure of an asynchronous operation
- Settled. Last and final state showing that the promise has either been fulfilled or rejected.
  A promise constructor uses a callback with two parameters. - resolve and reject

### Arrow functions

- Safety of scope
- Compactness
- Clarity
