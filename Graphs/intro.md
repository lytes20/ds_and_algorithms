# What is a Graph

- A collection of Nodes and edges. Graphs show or represent a collection within data.

BFS
Breadth First Search
Traversal/Search - is away to go through all elements of a data structure

Linear Traversal

- For loop
- While loop

Nested Traversal

- Nested for loop
- Nested while loop

## BFS traversal

- Traverses a graph by visiting adjacent nodes
- Finds the shortest path between two nodes

How

- Start at some node
- Visit all of that node's adjacent nodes
- For each node that was visited, repeat step 2 to visit all of their adjacent nodes and so on
- Stop when you fin a target node or until there are no more nodes
